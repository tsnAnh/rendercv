# GitHub Actions

## The Problem

Every software project has repetitive tasks that must run consistently:

- **On every update:** Run tests, redeploy documentation
- **On every release:** Run tests, update `schema.json` and examples, build executables for 4 platforms, build package, upload to PyPI, publish Docker image

You could do these manually. But manual means:

- Forgetting steps ("Did I update `schema.json`? Did I build the Windows executable?")
- Wasted time ("Why am I doing the same 15 steps every release?")

**What if you could write down these tasks once, and have them run automatically every time?**

That's what **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)** is. And **GitHub Actions** is GitHub's platform for it.

## What are GitHub Actions?

GitHub actions are **automation scripts that run on GitHub's servers when certain events happen**.

You define them in `.github/workflows/*.yaml` files. Each file describes:

1. **When to run:** push to main? Pull request? New release?
2. **What to do:** Run tests? Build docs? Publish package?
3. **Where to run:** Linux? Windows? macOS? Multiple versions?

GitHub reads these files and executes them automatically when the triggering events occur.

**Why GitHub's servers?** Because you don't want to worry about it. Push your code, turn off your computer, you're done. GitHub handles the rest (running tests, deploying docs, building packages) without you having to keep your machine on or manually run anything.

## RenderCV's Workflows

RenderCV has 4 workflows. Each handles a specific automation task.

**How workflows start:** Every workflow begins the same way: clone the repository, install `uv`, install `just`, then run some `just` commands. This recreates the same environment you'd have locally (see [Setup](index.md)).

### 1. [`test.yaml`](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yaml): Run Tests

**When it runs:**

- Every push to `main` branch
- Every pull request
- Manually (via GitHub UI)
- When called by other workflows

**What it does:**

1. Checks out the repository with submodules (the [rendercv-skill](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv-skill) submodule is needed for generated-file staleness tests)
2. Runs `just test-coverage` across **9 different environments** (3 operating systems × 3 Python versions: 3.12, 3.13, 3.14)
3. Combines all coverage reports and uploads them to show the coverage report

### 2. [`deploy-docs.yaml`](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yaml): Deploy Documentation

**When it runs:**

- Every push to `main` branch
- Manually (via GitHub UI)

**What it does:**

1. Builds the documentation website using `just build-docs`
2. Uploads it to GitHub Pages
3. Documentation is now live at https://docs.rendercv.com

### 3. [`create-executables.yaml`](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/blob/main/.github/workflows/create-executables.yaml): Create Executables

**When it runs:**

- Manually (via GitHub UI)
- When called by the release workflow

**What it does:**

1. Builds standalone executables using `just create-executable` for 4 platforms:
   - Linux (x86_64 and ARM64)
   - macOS (ARM64)
   - Windows (x86_64)
2. Uploads executables as artifacts

These are single-file executables that users can download and run without installing Python. They include the Python dependencies needed for `khaitranquang`, but they do not bundle Chromium; use the Docker image or a Python installation with Playwright's Chromium installed for `khaitranquang` PDF/PNG output.

### 4. [`release.yaml`](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yaml): Publish a Release

**When it runs:**

- When a new GitHub release is published

**What it does:**

This is the complete release pipeline. It orchestrates everything:

1. **Run tests:** Calls `test.yaml` to ensure everything works
2. **Build package:** Installs `uv`, builds Python wheel and source distribution using `uv build`
3. **Create executables:** Calls `create-executables.yaml` for all platforms
4. **Add assets to GitHub release:** Downloads and adds executables and wheel to the release
5. **Publish to PyPI:** Downloads and uploads package so users can `pip install rendercv`
6. **Publish Docker image:** Builds and pushes Docker image to GitHub Container Registry
