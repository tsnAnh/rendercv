### Added

- Four new themes have been added: `harvard`, `ink`, `opal`, and `ember`.

    - `--dont-generate-png`: Prevents the generation of the PNG files.
    - `--ANY.LOCATION.IN.THE.YAML.FILE "VALUE"`: Overrides the value of `ANY.LOCATION.IN.THE.YAML.FILE` with `VALUE`. This option can be used to avoid storing sensitive information in the YAML file. Sensitive information, like phone numbers, can be passed as a command-line argument with environment variables. This method is also beneficial for creating multiple CVs using the same YAML file by changing only a few values.
- New options have been added to the `rendercv new` command:
    - `--dont-create-theme-source-files`: Prevents the creation of the theme source files. By default, the theme source files are created.
    - `--dont-create-markdown-source-files`: Prevents the creation of the Markdown source files. By default, the Markdown source files are created.
